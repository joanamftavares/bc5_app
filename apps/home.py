            The most important steps to undertake for a new investor are the establishment of a plan and understand important concepts such as risk, diversity and include these in your investment plan as well as your reinvestment strategy. Investing involves risks and every investor must be aware of it before starting this journey. 
There are a few questions to consider when establishing your plan:
* How much can you invest? 
* How much can you afford to lose?  
* What is the primary objective of your investments? 
* How long are you investing for to reach that goal? 
* Are you aware of the investmentâ€™s terminology?
Other aspects should also be regarded, especially if you are investing in a high volatile market. Do you prefer to invest a large amount at once or invest regularly? For example, when investing in a volatile market, Pound Cost Averaging could be beneficial because by investing with regularity, you can balance the highs and lows of the market.
If you are interested in investing in the cryptocurrency market, be careful and look for reliable specialists. Be aware that cryptocurrency trading is a high-risk business, and you should not invest more money than you can afford to lose. Moreover, try to diversify your money among different cryptos, which decreases the risk of being harmed if there is a crash in one of the digital currencies.
